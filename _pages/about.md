<div style="text-align: justify">I am a doctoral researcher and cybersecurity professional working at the intersection of academic research and operational cyber defence. My work focuses on strengthening Cyber Situation Awareness (CSA) through the systematic integration of deception technologies, multi-layered monitoring architectures, and implementation-oriented defence models.

My research is grounded in the Design Science Research (DSR) paradigm, complemented by a constructive research approach. Rather than limiting inquiry to theoretical analysis, my work aims to design, develop, and refine practical artifacts—models, frameworks, and implementation concepts—that can be applied in real-world security operations environments. The core objective of my dissertation is to enhance the quality, reliability, and operational value of cyber situational awareness in complex and dynamic digital ecosystems.

A central theme in my research is the role of deception technologies—such as honeypots, honeytokens, and other low–false positive sensors—as structured components of modern defence ecosystems. I examine how these technologies can be systematically integrated into security architectures to improve detection capability, reduce uncertainty, and support both tactical and strategic decision-making. The research draws from multidisciplinary foundations, including information systems, cyber defence, cognitive models of situation awareness, and security engineering.

In parallel with my academic work, I have extensive professional experience in building and leading cyber detection and response capabilities. I have worked in safety-critical and high-demand environments where situational awareness is not merely theoretical, but essential for operational resilience. This dual perspective—researcher and practitioner—shapes my approach: theoretical rigor must align with implementability, scalability, and measurable impact.

Through this portfolio, I present my publications, research projects, conference contributions, and selected professional activities. My aim is to contribute to the development of cyber defence models that are both academically grounded and operationally viable—bridging the gap between conceptual understanding and practical implementation.</div>
