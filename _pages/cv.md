<div style="text-align: justify">My initial passion was telecommunications engineering, which gradually evolved into a deep interest in cybersecurity. This progression eventually led me into management roles focused on strategic development and capability building. With a technical background, I have come to understand that people are ultimately the most critical component of any high-value product or system. This realization continues to shape my research interests, particularly in the integration of technical architectures, organisational structures, and human decision-making within cyber defence ecosystems.</div>
