excerpt: 'IN REVIEW: Ensuring the ability to analyse and gain Cyber Situation Awareness (CSA) of the modern cyber operational environment is a significant challenge. One of the reasons for this problem is the multi-layered nature of the cyber environment, which is inherently complex, difficult to understand and constantly changing. This poses a challenge to incident analysis and therefore to the creation of the CSA. One method of improving visibility in the cyber environment is the use of deception technologies. This paper examines deception technologies to understand their role in supporting the incident analysis process. Finally, we propose a construction model for improving incident analysis using deception technologies. In addition, the results of the analysis are discussed and future research topics are identified.'
