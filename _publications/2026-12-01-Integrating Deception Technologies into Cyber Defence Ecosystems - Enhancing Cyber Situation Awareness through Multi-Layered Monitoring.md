excerpt: 'ACCEPTED: Deception technologies (DTs) can strengthen Cyber Situation Awareness (CSA) by producing low-noise, high-fidelity telemetry from adversary interactions. Building on prior work on medicaldevice modelling, ransomware analysis, and phase-based detection structuring, we examine how DTs can be integrated into broader cyber defence ecosystems. We synthesise five perspectives—technical, architectural, process, cognitive, and operational—and propose a Construction Model that treats deception telemetry as both a sensor input and an analytical catalyst within multi-layered monitoring. The model links DT deployments with fusion, reasoning, and feedback loops to improve visibility, correlation, and human–machine collaboration in SOC operations. Our key contribution is a structured pathway from deception sensing to actionable CSA in adaptive, intelligence-driven defence practices.'
