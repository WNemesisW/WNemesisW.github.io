excerpt: 'Cyber security is one of the key priorities in the modern digitalised and complex network totality. One of the major domains of interest is the healthcare sector where a cyber incident may cause unprecedented circumstances. In the healthcare domain there are abundant networked systems, software and hardware, which may be vulnerable for a cyber intrusion or incident. For cyber resilience, it is important to know the status of the valuable assets under attention. Sensor information has a significant role for achieving the comprehension of the valuable assets in the cyber domain. While networked medical devices form an important asset group in healthcare environment, one interesting solution to gather sensor information are the honeypots. In this paper, honeypot technology is studied for the healthcare domain. Especially typical characteristics of medical devices are considered from the perspective of modelling the medical devices with honeypots. The technical priorities are studied and concluded with the discovered future research topics.'
